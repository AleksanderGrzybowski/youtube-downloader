This is a simple app that can be used to download YouTube movies, optionally with audio extraction. My uncle was complaining about all those online extraction services that try to scam people and fool them to download some fake "Flash plugin" or other crap. So I took his complaints as an idea for a simple project.

Stuff used:
* Spring Boot + Spring Async + youtube-dl
* React + Bootstrap
